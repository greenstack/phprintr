# PHPrintrFormatter
Simply reads an input file with a PHP array or object printed out with print_r($var, true) and formats it to be easier to read.

You have two flags available:
  - --color (-c): Colors each indented line to help visualize the structure of the array/object further.
  - --file (-f): By entering a file name after this flag, the formatted array will be written to a file. This overrides --color.
